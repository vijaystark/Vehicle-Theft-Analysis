PROBLEM STATEMENT :                                                                                                                     
This system helps in analyzing the theft claims and revert with premium changes based on various aspects of theft.The analysis made earlier uses fixed datasets to produce results. The data may vary regularly. The day-today updated results are not visualized to the users. Hence the analysis visualized in earlier systems are not accurate. Our proposed system reduces the disadvantage by manually updating the dataset and producing updated visualized data to the users. The datasets are updated in particular interval of time so that the results visualized are more accurate. Tableau is the technology used to visualize the data. It explores in real time and reacts to change faster.


PROPOSED SYSTEM :                                                                                                                    
In our proposed system the analysis provided are more accurate. The datasets are requested from the insurance agencies to perform the analysis. The analysis for vehicle theft, insurance claims and fraud analysis are performed under single application. The datasets are updated with new data with regular intervals to obtain accurate result. The regions where the motor vehicle theft is high and agents under whom the false insurance claims are made is analyzed and can be visualized using Tableau. The time consumed for performing the analysis is very less.                                                                                                                  
ADVANTAGES :                                                                                                                        
•	Data provided after analysis is accurate.                                                                                             
•	All data are made available in single analysis                                                                                       
•	The regions where the vehicle theft is high are analyzed and listed.                                                                 
•	Whereas in this application current updates are possible.                                                                            


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS :                                                                                                               
False theft cases can be analysed and reported in minimal time. Agents under whom the false insurance is claimed can also be analysed.


CONCLUSION :                                                                                                                         
In vehicle theft analysis we have overcome major disadvantages of the existing system. The results visualized are more accurate. The Updation of the data in the dataset are made manual and it is regular. This process of updating data about all type of vehicle thefts consumes much lesser time. Regions where the theft is high are also analysed and visualized.
